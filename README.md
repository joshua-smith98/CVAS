# CVAS

CVAS stands for ***Concatenative Voice Announcement System***. It sounds fancy, but it's really quite simple.
At its basic level, this program takes a series of recorded phrases and attempts to speak a given sentence by stringing those phrases together. Think: automatic train announcements.

**Please note: CVAS is still in heavy development.
If you're looking for a finished & working program, try this one - its quite nice:** [jaboles/DVA5](https://github.com/jaboles/DVA5)
